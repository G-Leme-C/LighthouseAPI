# Lighthouse - Getting help to those who need it the most.

## The project

Lighthouse is a platform made for users to report people in need of help to government institutions and non-profit organizations.

## Motivation

Lighthouse was created by a group of students in Brazil as an academic project that aims to solve one of the 17 United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals.
The idea came up when we realized how hard is to get help from the government/non-profit organizations. There is no unified platform to bring help to those who need.

## Technology
    - C# for back-end language;
    - MongoDB for main data storage;
    - FluentValidation for model validation;
